# Introduction

This GitHub repository contains the R code used in the MSc thesis 'Comparing the performance of LC, LCT and tree-MILC analysis to correct for measurement error in the Employment Register and the Labour Force Survey' [link](https://github.com/eliscamastenbroek/master_thesis/blob/main/MSc_thesis.pdf))' by Elisca Mastenbroek.

In this README.md file, instructions are provided for reproducing the results of the two simulation studies (see Chapters 4-5) and the analyses of the real data (see Chapter 6). Note that the real data from the ER and the LFS is not publicly available.

# Software requirements
For this project, the following software was used:
- RStudio 2022.02.01
- R version 4.1.3
- Latent GOLD 6.0

# Reproducing Simulation study 1 (Chapter 4)
To reproduce the first simulation study, the functions in the following files should be loaded into the global environment.
