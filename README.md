# Introduction

This GitHub repository contains the R code used in the thesis 'Comparing the performance of LC, LCT and tree-MILC analysis to correct for measurement error in the Employment Register and the Labour Force Survey' by Elisca Mastenbroek.

Three types of analyses were conducted in this thesis, namely:
1. Simulation study 1 (Chapter 4)
2. Simulation study 2 (Chapter 5)
3. Analysis of real data (Chapter 6)

In the remainder of this README.md file, instructions are provided for how to reproduce the results of these analyses. Do note, however, that the real data from the ER and the LFS is not publicly available [Link text Here](https://link-url-here.org)
.

# Software requirements
